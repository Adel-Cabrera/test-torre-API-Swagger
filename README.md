# The dream

My main goal was to parse the API endpoints and use swagger to display and UI interface
to test it. 

# The fall

I encountered some serious problems when consuming the response object, so I'd to start all over again (after several hours).

I tried two different methods (ResponseTemplate & Feign) to make a simple get request and work with the object and store in H2 db the attributes, but all my efforts where futile.

# The lesson

I lack some experience doing this API calls, but I found this technical challenge to very fun.

Nevertheless, I'm grateful that I was considered in this recruitment process.

So, I wish you the best and hopefully find the right candidate for this position at Torre.co.

Thank you.
